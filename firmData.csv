Watanabe retired from the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), having reached the mandatory retirement age set forth in the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines.  Prior to his retirement, Mr. Watanabe had served as Lead Independent Director, Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and a member of the Compensation Committee of the Board.  The independent directors on the Board have designated Stanley M. Kuriyama, a current director on the Board, to serve as Lead Independent Director of the Board, in accordance with the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines.  Mr. Kuriyama On April 26, 2018, Dale Hendler resigned as Vice President and Controller (principal accounting officer) of the Company but continues in his position as Vice President, Financial Planning & Analysis, of Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (MatNav).  On April 26, 2018, the Board appointed Kevin L. Stuck as Vice President and Controller (principal accounting officer) of the Company.  Mr. Stuck, 52, served as Vice President, Accounting Center, of MatNav from April 2016 to April 2018 and Controller, Phoenix Accounting Center, of MatNav from April 2002 to April 2016.  Mr. Stuck first joined the Company or a subsidiary in 1999. On April 26, 2018, Mr. Stuck and the Company entered into an Executive Change in Control Agreement (the Letter Agreement).  The principal terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement are the same as those contained in the Executive Change of Control Agreement entered into by certain other Company executives in June 2012, October 2014 and April 2015.  The Letter Agreement is intended to encourage the executives continued employment with the Company by providing him with greater security in the event of termination of his employment following a change in control of the Company.  The Letter Agreement will expire on December 31, 2018, subject to automatic one-year extensions unless terminated by the Company; provided that the agreement will continue for twenty-four months if a change in control occurs during the term of the agreement.  The Letter Agreement provides for certain severance benefits if, during the term of the agreement, the executives employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason following a change in control event of the Company, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.  Upon such a termination of employment, the executive will be entitled to receive (i) a lump-sum severance payment equal to two times the sum of the executives base salary and target bonus, (ii) certain awards and amounts under various incentive and deferred compensation plans, (iii) an amount in connection with the cancellation of the executives outstanding Company stock options equal to the spread between the fair market value of the Companys stock subject to such options at the time of termination and the exercise price of such options, and (iv) any legal fees incurred as a result of the termination.  In addition, the Company will provide health and welfare benefits for the executives continued benefit for a period of two years after termination.  The Company will also reimburse the executive for individual outplacement counseling services. None The Letter Agreement is double trigger, so no payments are made and long-term incentives do not accelerate unless both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment occur.  There are no tax gross-ups under this agreement; payments may be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.  If there is a potential change in control of the Company, the executive agrees to remain in the employ of the Company until the earliest of (i) a date six months after the occurrence of the potential change in control, (ii) the termination of the executives employment by reason of disability or retirement, or (iii) the occurrence of a change in control of the Company. A copy of the Letter Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Exhibit.
