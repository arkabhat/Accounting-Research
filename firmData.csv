Storey, William P. Kelly and James E. Gilley (each, individually, an “Executive” and collectively, the “Executives”), which were approved by the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). The Agreements replace and terminate the previous Change of Control Agreements between the Company and the Executives, which were set to expire on February 29, 2016 (collectively, the “Prior Agreements”), and are substantially similar to the Prior Agreements. None Each of the Agreements has a term of four years, unless a “change of control” (as defined in the Agreements) of the Company occurs within such four-year period, in which case each Agreement is automatically extended for twelve months after the date of such change of control. Pursuant to the Agreements, if the applicable Executive’s employment is terminated within twelve months following a change in control (i) by the Company for any reason other than for “cause” (as defined in the Agreements), disability or death or (ii) by such Executive for “good reason” (as defined in the Agreements), the applicable Executive will receive certain payments and benefits. An Executive is not entitled to any payments and benefits if the Executive terminates the Executive’s employment without good reason. None The payments and benefits to be paid to the Executives pursuant to the Agreements are as follows: None ●    None Mr. Storey will receive (i) a cash payment equal to the sum of (x) 100% of his then-current base salary and (y) the average of his annual cash bonuses for the two fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs, (ii) health, life and disability insurance benefits for himself and, if applicable, his covered dependents for a period of twelve months after the date of termination and (iii) outplacement services for a period of twelve months following the date of termination, provided that the costs of such services to the Company may not exceed $15,000.   None ●    None Mr. Kelly will receive (i) a cash payment equal to the sum of (x) 75% of his then-current base salary and (y) the average of his annual cash bonuses for the two fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs, (ii) health, life and disability insurance benefits for himself and, if applicable, his covered dependents for a period of nine months after the date of termination and (iii) outplacement services for a period of nine months following the date of termination, provided that the costs of such services to the Company may not exceed $11,250.   None ●    None Mr. Gilley will receive (i) a cash payment equal to the sum of (x) 50% of his then-current base salary and (y) the average of his annual cash bonuses for the two fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs, (ii) health, life and disability insurance benefits for himself and, if applicable, his covered dependents for a period of six months after the date of termination and (iii) outplacement services for a period of six months following the date of termination, provided that the costs of such services to the Company may not exceed $7,500.   Under the Agreements, a change of control will have occurred if:   None ●    None current directors (the “incumbent board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any individual subsequently becoming a director whose election, or nomination for election by the company’s stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the then incumbent board, subject to limited exceptions, will be considered as though such individual was a member of the incumbent board; or   None ●    None stockholder approval of a reorganization, merger, consolidation or other form of corporate transaction or series of transaction (subject to limited exceptions), with respect to which stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not, immediately thereafter, own more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the reorganized, merged or consolidated entity’s then outstanding voting securities, or a liquidation or dissolution of the company or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company (unless such reorganization, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction, liquidation, dissolution or sale is subsequently abandoned or terminated prior to being consummated); or   None    None    None      None ●    None the acquisition by any person, entity or “group”, within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, of more than fifty percent (50%) of either the then outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock or the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (a “Controlling Interest”), excluding any acquisitions by (x) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (y) any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (z) any person, entity or “group” that currently beneficially owns a Controlling Interest.   Each of the Agreements contain term and post-termination confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition covenants.
